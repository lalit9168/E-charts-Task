Angular ECharts 
This Angular project demonstrates how to integrate ECharts, a powerful data visualization library, within an Angular application. It serves as a basic introduction to Angular components, data binding, and integrating third-party libraries into an Angular app. The app fetches static data and visualizes it using a bar chart with ECharts.

Project Overview
The application consists of two main components:

AppComponent: Displays the title and a brief description of the application.

ChartComponent: Displays a bar chart with static data using ECharts.

The app uses Angular's data binding features to pass data between components and render a visualization on the screen. The chart is configured with an array of sample data and is dynamically rendered using ECharts.

Features
Component Structure:

Created reusable components for the title/description and chart display.

Data Binding:

Used Angular's data binding features to pass data to the ECharts component.

ECharts Integration:

Installed and configured ECharts in the Angular application.

Rendered a bar chart with sample data.

Angular Lifecycle Hooks:

Used AfterViewInit to initialize the ECharts instance after the view has been fully rendered.

Steps to Set Up the Project
Install Dependencies:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run npm install to install all necessary dependencies.

Install ECharts via npm: npm install echarts --save.

Create Angular Components:

AppComponent: Displays a title and brief description.

ChartComponent: Visualizes data using ECharts (bar chart).

Data Handling:

Defined a simple data model and hardcoded data array.

Passed data to ChartComponent for visualization.

ECharts Integration:

Imported ECharts in ChartComponent.

Initialized the chart using the ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook.

Configured chart options such as chart type, series data, and axes.

Run the Application:

Run the app using ng serve and open it in your browser.

Challenges Faced
ECharts Initialization: The main challenge was ensuring the ECharts chart was initialized correctly after the component was rendered. This was solved by using Angularâ€™s AfterViewInit lifecycle hook, which ensures the chart is only initialized once the view is completely ready.

Data Binding: Passing data correctly between components was essential for dynamic chart rendering. I ensured that the data was passed through @Input() properties and updated efficiently.
